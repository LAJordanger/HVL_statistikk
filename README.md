# HVL_statistikk
An R-package with some simple shiny-applications, to be used when teaching statistics at [Western Norway University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hvl.no/en/).

**Note:** The interactive examples included in this package are restricted to (some of) the learning outcomes for the courses I am teaching. A few details about the included examples are given in the list below.

* Nothing here yet..., but work is in progress in order to create a first example where details related to the mean and median (and other quantiles) of a sample are investigated.
